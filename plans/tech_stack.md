### 7. Technology Stack Selection

*   **Frontend:** **React**
    *   *Justification:* Large community support, component-based architecture suitable for complex UI, rich ecosystem of libraries, good performance. Next.js framework for React provides benefits like Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) for SEO and performance.
*   **Backend:** **Node.js** with **Express.js** or **NestJS** (or Python with Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails)
    *   *Justification (Node.js):* JavaScript proficiency across stack (if using React/Vue), excellent performance for I/O-bound operations (like web requests), large package ecosystem (npm). NestJS provides a more structured, opinionated framework.
*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** 
    *   *Justification:* Robust, ACID compliant, reliable for transactional e-commerce data. Handles relational data well (Users, Orders, Products). Good support for JSONB fields if semi-structured data is needed.
*   **Cache:** **Redis**
    *   *Justification:* Very fast in-memory key-value store, ideal for caching sessions, API responses, rate limiting, and can serve as a message broker for the Job Queue.
*   **Search (Optional - Phase 2):** Elasticsearch or Algolia
    *   *Justification:* If basic DB search becomes insufficient, dedicated search engines offer powerful full-text search, filtering, and relevance tuning. Overkill for initial launch with few products.
*   **Hosting / Cloud Provider:** **AWS**
    *   *Justification:* Offers a wide range of managed services (RDS for PostgreSQL, ElastiCache for Redis, S3 for storage, CloudFront for CDN, EC2/ECS/EKS for compute, SES for email) that simplify deployment and scaling. Pay-as-you-go model.
*   **Containerization:** **Docker**
    *   *Justification:* Ensures consistent environments from development to production, simplifies deployment. Can be orchestrated with Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) for advanced scaling and management, or run on simpler services like ECS Fargate or App Runner initially.
*   **Payment Gateway:** **Stripe** (or Braintree/Adyen)
    *   *Justification:* Excellent developer experience, robust APIs, handles PCI compliance securely, widely trusted, good international support.
*   **Email Service:** **AWS SES** (or SendGrid, Mailgun)
    *   *Justification:* Cost-effective, reliable, integrates well with AWS infrastructure. SendGrid/Mailgun offer more features around deliverability and analytics if needed.
