### 14. Maintenance & Support Plan

1.  **Monitoring & Alerting:**
    *   **Uptime Monitoring:** External service (Pingdom, UptimeRobot) checking key pages (Homepage, API health endpoint). Alert on downtime.
    *   **Performance Monitoring (APM):** Tools like Datadog, New Relic, or Cloud provider's tools to monitor request latency, error rates, resource utilization (CPU, RAM, DB connections). Alert on anomalies/threshold breaches.
    *   **Error Tracking:** Service like Sentry to capture and aggregate frontend and backend exceptions. Alert on new or high-frequency errors.
    *   **Log Aggregation:** Centralized logging (ELK, Loki, CloudWatch Logs) for debugging and analysis.
    *   **Key Metric Monitoring:** Track business metrics (Registrations, Draw Entries, Orders, Revenue).
2.  **Bug Triage Process:**
    *   Bug reports received via support form or internal monitoring.
    *   Log bugs in an issue tracker (Jira, GitHub Issues).
    *   Prioritize bugs based on Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and Impact (e.g., blocking checkout vs. minor UI glitch).
    *   Assign bugs to developers.
    *   Fix bugs, test, deploy via CI/CD (potentially hotfix process for critical issues).
3.  **Update Schedule:**
    *   **Dependencies:** Regularly review and update third-party libraries/packages (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to patch security vulnerabilities and get improvements. Use tools like `npm audit` or Dependabot.
    *   **OS/System Patches:** Apply security patches to underlying server OS/containers as recommended by the provider (often handled by managed services).
    *   **Feature Updates:** Planned releases based on roadmap (post-launch).
4.  **Backup & Recovery:**
    *   Automated daily backups of the primary database.
    *   Regularly test the restore process (e.g., quarterly) to ensure backups are valid.
    *   Backup retention policy defined (e.g., keep daily backups for 7 days, weekly for a month, monthly for a year).
    *   Backup infrastructure configuration (IaC).
5.  **Customer Support:**
    *   Monitor email support form inquiries.
    *   Respond within a defined timeframe (e.g., 24-48 business hours).
    *   Maintain an internal knowledge base or FAQ for common support issues.
