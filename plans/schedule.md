### 15. Project Schedule & Resource Plan

*   **Methodology:** Agile (Kanban or short Sprints), focusing on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first if the 1-month deadline is strict.
*   **Assumed Team:** 1 Project Manager/Lead, 1-2 Frontend Devs, 1-2 Backend Devs, 1 UI/UX Designer (potentially part-time after initial design), 1 QA Tester. *This is lean for the scope.*

**Timeline (Aggressive MVP Focus):**

*   **Week 1: Foundation & Planning (Days 1-7)**
    *   Finalize Scope & Requirements (This document review).
    *   Detailed UI/UX Wireframes & Mockups (Key flows).
    *   Core Architecture Design & Tech Stack Confirmation.
    *   Setup Project Structure, Repos, CI/CD basics, Dev Environments.
    *   Backend: User Auth (Register, Login), Basic User Model/API.
    *   Frontend: Setup project, Basic Layout/Routing, Login/Register Forms.
    *   *Milestone: Basic Auth working, Core Design Approved.*
*   **Week 2: Core E-commerce & Drop Logic (Days 8-14)**
    *   Backend: Product Catalog Models/API, Drop Models/API, Basic Draw Entry Logic (no complex anti-bot yet), Cart API.
    *   Frontend: Homepage (Waitlist/Drop display), Product Listing (via Drop), PDP structure, Cart display/logic.
    *   Admin: Basic Product/Drop Management UI.
    *   *Milestone: Users can view drops, enter draws (basic), add items to cart (theoretically).*
*   **Week 3: Checkout, Draw Execution & Content (Days 15-21)**
    *   Backend: Checkout API logic, Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe), Order Model/API, Basic Draw Winner Selection logic, Simple Content API, Basic Notification triggers (Order conf).
    *   Frontend: Checkout Flow UI (Address, Payment), Order Confirmation page, Basic Content display page, User Account (Order History).
    *   Admin: Order Viewing, Basic Draw Execution trigger/view winners.
    *   *Milestone: Users can potentially complete a purchase after being marked a 'winner' manually by admin.*
*   **Week 4: Community, Polish, Testing & Deployment (Days 22-30)**
    *   Backend: Basic Forum API (Post/Reply - *Scope Risk*), Remaining Notifications (Shipment, Drop Start), Refinements, Security Hardening.
    *   Frontend: Basic Forum UI (*Scope Risk*), Localization implementation (string externalization), Final UI Polish, Responsive testing.
    *   Admin: Forum Moderation (*Scope Risk*), Refinements.
    *   **Intensive Testing:** Unit, Integration, End-to-End (QA).
    *   Develop Legal Docs (Privacy Policy, T&S).
    *   Infrastructure setup & Production Deployment prep.
    *   Final Deployment & Sanity Checks.
    *   *Milestone: MVP Launched (potentially with Forum deferred).*

**Resources:**

*   **Personnel:** As listed above. Full-time dedication required.
*   **Software:** Design tools (Figma), Project Management (Jira/Trello), Code Repos (GitHub/GitLab), IDEs.
*   **Infrastructure Costs:** Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure), Domain Name, Payment Gateway Fees, Email Service Fees, CDN.
*   **Budget:** Needs detailed estimation based on team salaries, software licenses, and projected infrastructure usage. A project of this scope, even rushed in 1 month, will likely involve significant cost.

**Key Risks & Mitigation:**

*   **Timeline:** Extremely high risk. Mitigation: Ruthlessly prioritize MVP features, defer complex elements (advanced bot detection, full forum features, extensive content), rely heavily on experienced developers and potentially pre-built components/frameworks. Expect overtime.
*   **Scope Creep:** High risk. Mitigation: Stick firmly to the defined MVP scope for the initial launch. Log future requests for Phase 2.
*   **Scalability Issues:** High risk, especially under drop load. Mitigation: Design for scalability from the start (stateless API, efficient DB queries, caching), but full load testing might be limited in 1 month. Plan for optimization post-launch.
*   **Security:** High risk if rushed. Mitigation: Prioritize secure coding practices, use secure defaults from frameworks, rely heavily on PCI-compliant gateway, conduct basic security checks, plan for thorough audit post-launch.
*   **Team Burnout:** High risk with 1-month deadline. Mitigation: Clear communication, realistic expectations (that 1 month is very hard), focus on core deliverables.
