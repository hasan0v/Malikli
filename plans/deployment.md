### 13. Deployment Plan

1.  **Environments:**
    *   **Development:** Local developer machines.
    *   **Staging:** A production-like environment for testing and QA. Uses dedicated resources (DB, Cache) seeded with test data. Deployed to automatically on merge to `staging` branch.
    *   **Production:** The live environment serving users. Deployed to manually/semi-automatically after successful staging validation from `main` branch.
2.  **Version Control:** Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow or simpler GitHub Flow).
3.  **CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins):**
    *   **Trigger:** On push/merge to main branches (`main`, `staging`, feature branches).
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Lint Code.
        *   Run Unit Tests.
        *   Run Integration Tests (against test DB/services).
        *   Build Frontend Assets.
        *   Build Docker Images (Frontend, Backend, Worker).
        *   Push Images to Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCP GCR).
        *   Deploy to Staging Environment (Automated).
        *   (Manual Step) QA & Approval on Staging.
        *   Deploy to Production Environment (Manual Trigger or Tag-based).
        *   Run Database Migrations (Using tools like Sequelize CLI, Alembic, Flyway).
4.  **Release Process:**
    *   Features developed on separate branches.
    *   Pull Requests created for review.
    *   Merged to `staging` for QA.
    *   Once approved, merge `staging` to `main`.
    *   Tag `main` branch with a version number (e.g., v1.0.0).
    *   Trigger production deployment from the tag.
5.  **Rollback Strategy:**
    *   Ability to quickly redeploy the previous stable version's Docker images.
    *   Database migration rollback scripts prepared and tested.
    *   CDN cache purging mechanism.
6.  **Initial Deployment:**
    *   Provision infrastructure (Cloud resources, DB, Cache, etc.) - potentially using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) like Terraform or CloudFormation.
    *   Configure DNS settings.
    *   Seed initial data (Admin user, Categories).
    *   Perform full system test before launch.
